11/15/2006 - Persister/ObjectServer/Schema Refactoring
--------------------------------------------------------

- Extent with subclasses should not include schema classes in extent because they cannot be retrieved directly.

- ObjectServer should have server-wide object write-thru cache. Looks up objects by OID. Updated on commit.

- Needs tests for Persister and new ObjectServerSession methods.
- Tests for PersistableHelper.resolveObject()

- Problem with DumpRedoLog on large logs that weren't committed it hangs at end. I think this is in ArchivingRedoLogServer 
 buffered reader.
 
- Add tests for serialization of  enum types. Figure out how they're stored.
