12/5/2006 - Persister/ObjectServer/Schema Refactoring
--------------------------------------------------------

- Test read/write of large objects that exceed page size (more than 2 pages).

- LargePersistentHashMap/set. B+tree
- Stream-based PersistentByteArray. Implements InputStream/OutputStream.

- Test PolePosition

- ObjectServer should have server-wide object write-thru cache. Looks up objects by OID. Updated on commit.
  Will this really help?

- Needs tests for Persister and new ObjectServerSession methods.
- Tests for PersistableHelper.resolveObject()

- Problem with DumpRedoLog on large logs that weren't committed it hangs at end. I think this is in ArchivingRedoLogServer 
 buffered reader.
 
- Add tests for serialization of  enum types. Figure out how they're stored.
