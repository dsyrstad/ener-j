Tests:


MROWLock:
     +  acquire/release methods are reentrant (e.g., a read or write lock can be taken multiple times).
     +  acquiring a read lock followed by acquiring a write lock is allowed (lock transition) if
        thread is only reader (two cases here). After the
        write lock is released, the read lock should still be active.
     +  multiple readers are allowed.
     +  one OR more readers blocks a writer. Writer is granted when readers are released.
     +  only a single writer is allowed (two writers can't exist).
     +  a single writer blocks a reader. Reader is granted when writer is released.
     +  test RuntimeExceptions on release when lock not active.
