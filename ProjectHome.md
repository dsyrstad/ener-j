Ener-J is an open-source Java<sup>TM</sup>-based object-oriented database system (ODBMS). It implements the ODMG 3.0 Java API along with full OQL capabilities. The entire system is pluggable and extensible.

Ener-J is a exclusively designed for the Java environment. It is written in Java and its aim is to take advantage of the Java language and platform. To encompass other language bindings would mean that Ener-J would require more language-independent object capabilities and would result in weaker overall object integration for each language.

Ener-J development is currently dormant, but the source is here for you to peruse.
