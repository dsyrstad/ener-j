To Do
-----
- ASTs - DefineQuery, InClause, QuantifierExpr, InExpr, GroupClause

- OJB and LDB have OQL tests. 

- LDB has various sample database schemas. 

- 4.10.15 - Projection field names are variables usable in where clause. Likewise, group by variable names are usable in the
projection. Group by introduces "partition". having and order by cannot see the from variables.

- If arg to InvokeMethod/InvokeNoArgMethod/GetField is null, and it's not a static method, return null.

- DArray should extend DList. An array is a list.

- Should have a base collection class for the ODMG "D" collections. Also BaseDSet. These would implement
the common operations. 

- Extract union/difference/intersection/concat from D* collections into utility classes that 
operate on regular Collections.

- Need dynamic collection classes. E.g., List concat should be a List class that takes two lists 
 and dynamically return values. Same for intersect, diff, union. Hopefully, most joins could be 
 done this way too. These should be optimized for one-time forward access (e.g., Iteration).

- date/time/timestamp "2005-04-04" should be supported as date '2005-04-04' (single quotes)
