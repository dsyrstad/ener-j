12/5/2006 - Persister/ObjectServer/Schema Refactoring
--------------------------------------------------------

- OO7 bind map early.
- OO7 Change RegularD... to VeryLarge...

- Remove RegularD... add VeryLarge Equiv. Rename VeryLarge to PersitentList...

- Change ObjectSerializer to use ByteArrayUtil.putUTF8

- Try enabling writeThru on cachedPageServer and benchmarking.

- Test PolePosition

- ObjectServer should have server-wide object write-thru cache. Looks up objects by OID. Updated on commit.
  Will this really help?

- Needs tests for Persister and new ObjectServerSession methods.
- Tests for PersistableHelper.resolveObject()

- Problem with DumpRedoLog on large logs that weren't committed it hangs at end. I think this is in ArchivingRedoLogServer 
 buffered reader.
 
- Add tests for serialization of  enum types. Figure out how they're stored.
