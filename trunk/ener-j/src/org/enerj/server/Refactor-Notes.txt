11/15/2006 - Persister/ObjectServer/Schema Refactoring
--------------------------------------------------------

- Maybe objs should be written async to db at same time as log to eliminate update cache requirement. If
  we do this, only rollback involves reading the log to restore values in the db. This would also eliminate
  the requirement of checking the update cache when reading objects. This change should be made in SVN 
  isolatation so that it may be backed out.

- ObjectServer should have server-wide object write-thru cache. Looks up objects by OID. Updated on commit.

- Needs tests for Persister and new ObjectServerSession methods.
- Tests for PersistableHelper.resolveObject()

- Problem with DumpRedoLog on large logs that weren't committed it hangs at end. I think this is in ArchivingRedoLogServer 
 buffered reader.
 
- Add tests for serialization of  enum types. Figure out how they're stored.
