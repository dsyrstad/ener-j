12/9/2006 - Persister/ObjectServer/Schema Refactoring
--------------------------------------------------------

- Test read/write of large objects that exceed page size (more than 2 pages).

-  B+tree
- Maps need a wrapper that provides duplicate/unique key functionality for an index. Unique index
  should throw if a duplicate put is attempted. A Duplicate index map entry should point directly to the
  object if the key is unique, otherwise to an array if less than 100 entries, or a LargePersistentArrayList
  if more than 100. Need to be able to remove by key and value for duplicates.
  
- OO7's array for atomic parts needs a non-unique index on id. Currently entries are overwritten.
- Stream-based PersistentByteArray. Implements InputStream/OutputStream.

- Test PolePosition

- ObjectServer should have server-wide object write-thru cache. Looks up objects by OID. Updated on commit.
  Will this really help?

- Needs tests for Persister and new ObjectServerSession methods.
- Tests for PersistableHelper.resolveObject()

- Problem with DumpRedoLog on large logs that weren't committed it hangs at end. I think this is in ArchivingRedoLogServer 
 buffered reader.
 
- Add tests for serialization of  enum types. Figure out how they're stored.
