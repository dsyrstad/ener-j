11/15/2006 - Persister/ObjectServer/Schema Refactoring
--------------------------------------------------------

- ObjectServer should have server-wide object write-thru cache. Looks up objects by OID. Updated on commit.

- Needs tests for Persister and new ObjectServerSession methods.

- Get rid of references to EnerJTransaction.getCurrentTransaction() in PersistableHelper. This may
  cause problems in the server. Instead ask Persister if a transaction is active.
