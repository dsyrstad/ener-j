SCO Tests:

General:
    + Test that SCOs modify their owners, even if SCO is several times
      removed via a multidimensional array or Collection.
    + Test that various SCO mutator methods cause modification and that they set the
      proper value on the SCO.
    + Cloning of SCO subclass should set owner to null.
    - If _only_ a SCO is modified (not any other owner fields), not only should the owner be marked modified, but
      the owner should get committed to the database. This ensures that the owner is being added to
      the modified list.
